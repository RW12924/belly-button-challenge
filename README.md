# belly-button-challenge

The purpose of this code was to extract raw data from the provided JSON URL, organize the data, and generate 
visualizations of the data in a dashboard.  The raw data consisted of individual test subjects and the subjects' 
respective belly button microbial population.

The resulting dashboard was designed to allow viewers to select individual test subjects by their ID number
and dynamically generate visualizations for the data gathered from the test subject.  The visualizations of
the dashboard include the demographic data of each subject, the top 10 bacteria cultures found for each subject,
and the number of each bacteria type within each sample.
